# Intro
This is a simple game engine programmed in C# with a windows forms based renderer. Currently there is a launcher and 2 example games. I made this as a fun challenge and to learn some more advanced C# skills.\
# Usage
Games can be created by adding a new form and using the `WinFormsGameEngineAPI` library, and then by creating entities. These will then be rendered using buttons, and simulated by the API. There is a launcher where the forms can be opened from.
